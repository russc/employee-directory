# Employee Directory Info

## Technologies Used

- [Random Users](https://randomuser.me/)) I actually downloaded a set of data for this, as I wanted to place it in my Postgres database and have access to all of the data via the GraphQL server I set up.
- [Hasura GraphQL Engine](https://hasura.io/) A GraphQL server based on a Postgres schema.
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/) For Queries and Mutations
- [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started)
- [Material UI (MUI)](https://material-ui.com/) React Component Library
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) Used to customize styles of both native elements and MUI components
